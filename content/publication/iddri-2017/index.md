abstract: "This report highlights the relevance of regional ocean governance (ROG) for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, the achievement of SDG14, and the transition to ecosystem-based management more generally. The report assesses the roles and mandates of different regional approaches and frameworks, and showcases some pragmatic and practical examples of ROG efforts that may provide useful lessons for the implementation of SDG14. The report also highlights some of the key contributions that regional approaches can make to some of the overarching challenges of the 2030 Agenda, including capacity development, institutional transformation, and sustainable financing."
