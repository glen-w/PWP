abstract: "The Southeast Atlantic and Southeast Pacific regions are both characterised by their high biological productivity, supported by important oceanic currents. Recognising the need to ensure conservation and sustainable use of this biodiversity, coastal States in these regions cooperate through regional organisations to improve ocean governance, including in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJ). This report uses the issues under discussion in the ongoing negotiations for a new legally binding instrument and selected Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets as a lens through which to assess progress towards conservation and sustainable use."
