I am currently a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI), based in Paris. I work on various aspects of marine policy and ocean governance, specialising in the high seas/areas beyond national jurisdiction, regional ocean policy, marine spatial planning, and the regulation of wave and tidal energy technologies.

I run Little Blue Letter, an uplifting ocean newsletter curated each week by a young leader in marine science and policy, and Academia Obscura, a popular twitter account musing on the lighter side of academic life (now a book!).
